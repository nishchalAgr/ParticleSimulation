# ParticleSimulation
2D "Physics" Simulation of Dirt, Water, ect.

### Implementation:
- Programmed in Java using the Processing library
- The basic concept behind the code is based on cellular automata, with cell rules based on which particle is being spawned

### Controls:
- Use mouse to move cursor
- SHIFT to spawn particle at cursor position
- A , D to cycle through particle types

### Current Features:
- Water and Dirt particles
- Basic UI 

### Upcoming Features (hopefully):
- More realistic kinematics (ie. projectile motion)
- More particles (ie. Fire, Wood, Oil)
- Particle colors change based on other nearby particles
- GUI
